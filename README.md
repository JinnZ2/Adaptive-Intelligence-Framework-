# Adaptive Intelligence Framework

Mathematical framework for understanding intelligence as substrate-independent 
information processing under constraints.

## Core Components

### Universal Adaptive Intelligence (UAI)
Formal framework showing structural isomorphism across:
- Human survival intelligence
- Plant adaptive growth  
- Crystalline stress response
- Mycelial network optimization
- AI learning dynamics

**Key insight**: Same mathematical structure, different substrates.

### ΔX Consistency Test
Empirical method for detecting when institutional authority claims are 
narrative (political) vs. operational (competency-based).

**Key measure**: 
- ρ_hidden = fraction of work done by auxiliary nodes
- NDS = Narrative-vs-Dynamics Score (0 = operational, 1 = narrative)

### Institutional Dynamics
Models for:
- Vulnerability cascades in hierarchical networks
- Suppression mechanisms for non-institutional intelligence
- Resource optimization under constraint

## Applications

- AI safety: Detecting when "human oversight" claims are unsupported
- Organizational analysis: Identifying manufactured authority
- Systems resilience: Understanding failure modes in hierarchical structures
- Cross-substrate learning: Applying optimization principles from nature

## Status

Working notes. Mathematical framework with implementation examples.
Use as diagnostic tool and theoretical foundation.
